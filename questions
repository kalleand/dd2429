Questions for lab2.

* Question 1.
	The rank of the matrix E and E_corr when:
	* Points correspond perfectly: full rank (or maybe full rank - 1 due to
	  homogenous equation system)
	* Points does not correspond perfectly: the rank is not full due
	  to some vectors being linear combinations of others in the E matrix.

* Question 2.
	This can be detected in the singular value decomposition.
	Namely in the V matrix - which is a diagonal matrix containing
	the singular values - by noting that all points are 0 or close
	to each other (unstable solution).

* Question 3.
	You would construct several E matrices. One E matrix for
	camera 1 to 2, one E matrix for camera 2 to 3 and so on to
	the last E matrix that maps camera m to 1.	

* Question 4.
	More points and more cameras. Solving the optimization problem
	of minimizing the error would improve the model a lot as well.
