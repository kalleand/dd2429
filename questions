Questions for lab2.

* Question 1.
	The number of degrees of freedom of E and E_corr for:
	* Points correspond perfectly: 0
	* Points does not correspond perfectly: 8

* Question 2.
	This can be detected in the singular value decomposition.
	Namely in the S matrix - which is a diagonal matrix containing
	the singular values - by noting that all points are 0.

* Question 3.
	You would construct several E matrices. One E matrix for
	camera 1 to 2, one E matrix for camera 2 to 3 and so on to
	the last E matrix that maps camera m to 1.	

* Question 4.
	More points and more cameras. Solving the optimization problem
	of minimizing the error would improve the model a lot as well.
